# Assignment 5: Huffman Coding

## Description
In this program, we are making a program that uses Huffman's method to encode and decode messages.
##Building
Run this command to compile the program
```
$ make all
```

##Running/Instructions
Run this command to test/see the encode functions.
```
$ ./encode
```
You can run whatever command you wish after the following code above. Note: -h will give you a menu.

```
$ ./decode
```
You can run whatever command you wish after the following code above. Note -h will give you a menu.
