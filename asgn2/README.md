# Assignment 2: A Little Slice of Pi

## Description
In this program, we are making a bunch of different math functions that test out our accuracy towards computing pi and e depending on the formulas/methods. We implemented Taylor series to compute e. We implemented Euler's solution, Madhava series, BBP formula, and Viete's formula to compute pi. We also calculated sqrt using Newton-Raphson method. Throughout our computation, we kept track on how many computations we went through before reaching our final number.

##Building
Run this command to compile the program
```
$ make all
```

##Running/Instructions
Run this command to test/see the functions.
```
$ ./mathlib-test 
```
You can run whatever command you wish after the following code above. Note: -h will give you a menu.
